      excerpt: VEBA takes automation to the next level by using event-driven integrations and interactions as the foundation. In this session, together with a VMware partner, we will demonstrate how our partners and communities can unlock the hidden potential of software-defined datacenter events to build event-driven automation and integrations. Event-driven systems open up new possibilities and massively increase time-to-value.

      author_name: Robert Guske
      excerpt: The open-source container registry Harbor supports the configuration of webhook endpoints. Harbor notifies the webhook endpoint of certain events that occur in a project. However, the event sent is not delivered as a CloudEvent. By leveraging the power of VEBA the non-CloudEvent can be send to a webhook function to get transformed in a CloudEvent. By transforming the event, other functions can be subscribed to the new event to ultimately get triggered.
